## Final Project: 
### Introduction:
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer. 
### Step One - Choose Your Data Set 
Click [this link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf) (available in a Google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub?embedded=True&urp=gmail_link&gxids=7628)) to open a document with links and information about data sets that you can investigate for this project. You must choose one of these datasets to complete the project. 
### Step Two - Get Organized 
Eventually you’ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before you begin. We recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain: <br>
* The report communicating your findings 
* Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis 
* The data set you used (which you will not need to submit) <br> 

You may wish to use a Jupyter notebook, in which case you can submit both the code you wrote and the report of your findings in the same document. Otherwise, you will need to submit your report and code separately. If you would like a notebook template to help organize your investigation, you can click [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5ac7a08a_investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb/investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb.zip&ust=1619689380000000&usg=AOvVaw3H_DXeAhZ758SDZtvtqzhX&hl=en&source=gmail). 

### Step Three - Analyze Your Data 
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. You can find some questions in the [data set options](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf) to help you get started.Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate! 

### Step Four - Share Your Findings 
Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. You should also feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily. 

### Step Five - Review 
Push to your github repo, it will be reviewed and feedback will be sent to you shortly. 


## Benefits:
1. Strong profile on Github.
2. Department award for top 3 students.
3. Students will be certified with a total of 140 hrs hands-on experience. 
4. Daily office hours for support/guidance.
5. Get the chance to meet new students who share your interests.
6. Start exploring and building models on Kaggle which is the largest online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners.

## Evaluation Method to receive certificates:
1. Students must attend +80% of total sessions.
2. Students must hand in all the required projects within 48 hrs after each session using an online platform (Github)
 


## Notes:
1. Each session will be uploaded in a private playlist on youtube for ease of access after the session.
2. Students with a github account have privilege during the selection process. 
3. Required projects after each session could be adjusted.
4. Lack of commitment could lead to exclusion. 
5. Students with basics of any programming language are preferable. 
6. Additional sessions may be set to fulfill the content.
7. Student may need to bring his/her personal laptops.
